    "    A matrix of values where each row represents a conformation and the features along the columns\n",

    "#### complete:\n",
    "    For the purposes of identifying the coincidence of misclassification and missing residues beyond a certain threshold. Complete is a boolean, if True it will use the full matrix of data. Else if false, that means chains_list is reduced_chains_list (a shorter chain where every conformation has less than threshold missing residues as defined by the last run threshold_reduce function)\n",

    "#### auto_cut_tree:\n",
    "    By default the tree will be automatically cut by the number of clusters, however, if set to False, manual cutting will ask the user to get left or right tree in a sequence from top down.\n",
